In this initial step, we introduce the concept of bringing your on-premises Active Directory (AD) environment into the virtual realm of Azure VMs, setting the stage for the upcoming steps while exploring the benefits and reasons behind using it.

<p>
In this step, we guide you through the process of creating Azure Virtual Machine ,seting up the necessary VM  that will house your on-premises AD components.

<p>
With your VMs ready, it's time to configure your on-premises Active Directory with necessary steps to install and set up AD domain controllers within your Azure VMs. This part establishes the foundation for your virtual AD environment.
<br />
 final step, we bring it all together, establish connectivity between your on-premises Active Directory and Azure services. We'll explore techniques to enable secure communication and synchronization, allowing your AD environment to extend into the cloud.
